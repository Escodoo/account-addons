The Multi-Company Bank Account Synchronization module aims to ensure that all companies within a business group have the same bank accounts registered and updated, so that all of them can carry out financial transactions without data compatibility issues.

The synchronization is performed automatically, so that the addition, update or deletion of a bank account in one of the companies is reflected in all other companies of the group. To ensure data integrity, the module also checks whether the bank account can be deleted without compromising the integrity of the records in other companies.
