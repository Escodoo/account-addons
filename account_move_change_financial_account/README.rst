This module allows for the automatic changing of financial accounts in accounting move lines (account.move.line) based on predefined rules. This simplifies the application of specific accounting policies without the need for manually adjusting each accounting move.

Key Features:

1. Define financial account substitution rules through the account_account_financial_rule class.
2. Apply the substitution rules during the creation of new accounting moves (account.move).
3. Supports rules based on specific criteria, such as the partner involved in the transaction.

With the account_move_change_financial_account module, users can easily set up and apply custom financial rules, streamlining the accounting process and ensuring compliance with the company's accounting policies.

Usage
=====

- Install the account_move_change_financial_account module.
- Navigate to the financial rules menu (Accounting > Configuration > Financial Rules) and create a new rule by defining the domain condition and the new financial account to be applied.
- When a new accounting move is created and meets the financial rule's domain condition, the financial account of the applicable lines will be automatically changed according to the rule.
- Review the accounting moves to ensure that the financial rules have been correctly applied.
